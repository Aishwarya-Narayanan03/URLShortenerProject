# URLShortenerProject
URL shortening software The Django project is a web application that allows users to shorten large URLs and make them more manageable. 
URL shorteners are useful for sharing links on sites that have character constraints, such as social media, and they help make long and complex URLs more visually appealing.

### Here's a high-level summary of how a URL shortener Django project might be built:
1. To begin, create a new Django project or use an existing one. If you don't already have Django installed, you can install it with pip, the Python package manager.
2. Create a new Django app for the URL shortener functionality once the project is up and running. Django apps are Django project modules that handle specific tasks.
3. Create the URL shortener's data model. The primary model will save two key pieces of data: the original long URL and the related short URL. You may also want to provide some metadata, such as the number of times the short URL has been visited or the date it was generated.
4. Define the views that handle the URL shortener logic. Views are required for the following features: Displaying the form to enter the long URL for shortening, Handling the form submission, and generating the short URL
Redirecting the short URL to its corresponding long URL
5. Make HTML templates to display the user interface. You'll need templates to display the form and the short URL produced.
6. Create a Django form to handle the lengthy URL user input. Django forms support validation and error handling, which makes it easier to manage user data.
7. To map the relevant URLs to their associated views, configure the URL routing in Django's urls.py file. For example, URLs are required for form display, form submission, and short URL redirection.
8. Choose a method for generating the short URL from the long URL. This might be as easy as hashing the long URL to get a unique shortcode or as complex as utilizing a base conversion technique. The produced short URL should then be linked to the database's matching long URL.
9. When a user visits a shortened URL, utilize the view and logic to redirect the user to the long URL associated with that short URL. This entails retrieving the long URL from the database depending on the request's short URL field.
10. Create an easy-to-use interface that allows users to enter a large URL and get a shortened version.
11. Deploy the Django project to a web server or cloud platform to make it available to people all over the world.
